The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile., Other Name: ANN1;ANNAT1;ANNEXIN 1;ATANN1;ATOXY5;OXY5;annexin 1, Keywords: calcium ion transmembrane transport;phloem sucrose unloading;potassium ion export across plasma membrane;primary root development;response to abscisic acid;response to cold;response to heat;response to osmotic stress;response to oxidative stress;response to salt stress;response to water deprivation;response to cold;response to heat;response to salt stress;response to water deprivation;cytoplasm;plasma membrane;apoplast;chloroplast;chloroplast stroma;cytosol;membrane;mitochondrion;nucleus;plant-type cell wall;plant-type vacuole;plasma membrane;plasmodesma;root hair tip;thylakoid;cytosol;ATP binding;calcium ion binding;calcium-dependent phospholipid binding;copper ion binding;peroxidase activity;phosphatidylserine binding;protein homodimerization activity;zinc ion binding;L mature pollen stage;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;LP.06 six leaves visible stage;LP.08 eight leaves visible stage;LP.10 ten leaves visible stage;LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage;M germinated pollen stage;flowering stage;mature plant embryo stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo bilateral stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;plant embryo globular stage;seedling development stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;cotyledon;cultured plant cell;flower;flower pedicel;fruit;guard cell;hypocotyl;inflorescence meristem;leaf apex;leaf lamina base;petal;petiole;plant embryo;pollen;pollen tube cell;primary root;root;root cap;root epidermis;rosette leaf;seed;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stamen;stem;trichome;vascular leaf;exodermis;hypocotyl epidermis;primary root elongation zone;root cap;root epidermis;root hair cell;cell-to-cell mobile RNA,"

It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast; both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.

AT1G50030,protein_coding,"Description: TOR is a protein kinase; conserved across eukaryotes (called mTOR in mammals), that monitors nutrient availability to coordinate metabolism (PMID: 32649861). TOR is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) and forms a stable complex (TOR complex 1, or TORC1) with RAPTOR (At3g08850, At5g01770, PMID: 16377759) and LST8 (At3g18140, At2g22040, PMID: 22307851). TOR is expressed throughout Arabidopsis development (PMID: 32188942, PMID: 32051250) and is required to complete embryogenesis (PMID: 11983923). Diverse nutrients, hormones, and environmental cues can activate or suppress TOR activity (depending on the physiological and developmental context), including sugars (PMID: 23542588), amino acids (PMID: 33831352, PMID: 35327579), nucleotides (PMID: 33793860), auxins (PMID: 28246118), and light (PMID: 28223530). When conditions are favorable, TOR promotes growth by activating cell division (PMID: 23542588), cell expansion (PMID: 33288701), ribosome biogenesis (PMID: 33054972), protein synthesis (PMID: 33054972), and nucleotide synthesis (PMID: 33793860), among other processes.

AT2G27250,protein_coding,"Description: One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide; in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673)., Other Name: AtCLV3;CLAVATA3;CLV3, Keywords: cell differentiation;cellular component organization;innate immune response;maintenance of meristem identity;meristem development;regulation of meristem structural organization;signal transduction;cell surface receptor signaling pathway;pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway;apoplast;extracellular region;mitochondrion;receptor serine/threonine kinase binding;signaling receptor binding;apical meristem;central zone;flower meristem,"

Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1.

AT2G47460,protein_coding,"Description: MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS); flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots.

It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root; shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators., Other Name: ARR22;RR22;response regulator 22, Keywords: cytokinin-activated signaling pathway;regulation of DNA-templated transcription;chloroplast;cytoplasm;nucleus;phosphorelay response regulator activity;protein histidine phosphatase activity;fruit development stage;seed development stage;chalaza;flower;fruit;hilum;stem;vascular leaf;flower bud;stem;vascular leaf,"

One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization.

AT4G39400,protein_coding,"Description: Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane; when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.

Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT., Other Name: CDF1;CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1, Keywords: chloroplast organization;negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription;regulation of DNA-templated transcription;regulation of timing of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase;vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem;nucleus;DNA binding;DNA-binding transcription factor activity;DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific;RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding;protein binding;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;LP.06 six leaves visible stage;LP.08 eight leaves visible stage;LP.10 ten leaves visible stage;flowering stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo globular stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;companion cell;cotyledon;flower;flower pedicel;guard cell;hypocotyl;inflorescence meristem;leaf apex;leaf lamina base;petal;plant embryo;plant sperm cell;pollen;portion of vascular tissue;root;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stamen;stem;stomatal complex;vascular leaf,"

AT5G58230,protein_coding,"Description: Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation;as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1., Other Name: ARABIDOPSIS MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1;ATMSI1;MEE70;MSI1;MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1;maternal effect embryo arrest 70, Keywords: embryo development ending in seed dormancy;heterochromatin formation;heterochromatin organization;leaf development;multicellular organism development;negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase III;pollen development;positive regulation of cell cycle;regulation of flower development;seed coat development;seed development;trichome differentiation;chromatin remodeling;regulation of DNA-templated transcription;nucleus;DRM complex;nucleus;Cul4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex;chromatin silencing complex;protein-containing complex;histone binding;protein binding;transcription corepressor binding;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;LP.06 six leaves visible stage;LP.08 eight leaves visible stage;LP.10 ten leaves visible stage;LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage;flowering stage;mature plant embryo stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo bilateral stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;plant embryo globular stage;pollen development stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;cotyledon;embryo sac;endosperm;flower;flower pedicel;fruit;guard cell;hypocotyl;inflorescence meristem;leaf apex;leaf lamina base;microgametophyte vegetative cell;petal;petiole;plant embryo;plant ovule;plant sperm cell;pollen;root;seed;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stamen;stem;vascular leaf,"

Sequence is similar to HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box binding factor. HAP3 subunit is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal A domain; a central B domain, and a carboxyl-terminal C domain. LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis.

AT1G70560,protein_coding,"Description: TAA1 is involved in the shade-induced production of indole-3-pyruvate (IPA); a precursor to IAA, a biologically active auxin. It is also involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development from embryogenesis to flower formation and plays a role in ethylene-mediated signaling. This enzyme can catalyze the formation of IPA from L-tryptophan. Though L-Trp is expected to be the preferred substrate in vivo, TAA1 also acts as an aminotransferase using L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Met, and L-Gln. Lines carrying mutations in this gene are unaffected by auxin transporter inhibitor NPA. Double mutant analysis and exogenous auxin treatment suggest that this gene is required for auxin signaling during lateral root and root meristem development. The activity of TAA1 can be controlled by phosphorylation of residue T101, which, when phosphorylated results in loss of activity. TAA1 is a target of TMK4., Other Name: CKRC1;SAV3;SHADE AVOIDANCE 3;TAA1;TIR2;TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 2;TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1;WEAK ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 8;WEI8;cytokinin induced root curling 1, Keywords: auxin polar transport;auxin-activated signaling pathway;cotyledon development;cotyledon vascular tissue pattern formation;defense response to bacterium;embryo development ending in seed dormancy;flower development;gynoecium development;indoleacetic acid biosynthetic process;leaf development;maintenance of root meristem identity;phloem or xylem histogenesis;positive gravitropism;primary root development;response to ethylene;root development;shade avoidance;shoot system development;amino acid metabolic process;cytoplasm;nucleus;L-alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activity;L-leucine-2-oxoglutarate transaminase activity;L-methionine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activity;L-phenylalanine-2-oxoglutarate transaminase activity;L-phenylalanine-pyruvate transaminase activity;L-tryptophan:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activity;L-tryptophan:pyruvate aminotransferase activity;L-tyrosine-pyruvate transaminase activity;protein binding;pyridoxal phosphate binding;transaminase activity;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;flowering stage;mature plant embryo stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo bilateral stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;plant embryo globular stage;seedling development stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;apical hook;apical meristem;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;cotyledon;cotyledon adaxial epidermis;embryo shoot apical meristem;embryo vascular system;epidermis;flower;flower meristem;flower pedicel;guard cell;gynoecium;hypocotyl;hypocotyl vascular system;leaf lamina base;leaf margin;leaf vascular system;meristem L1 layer;petal;petiole;plant embryo;pollen;quiescent center;root;root apical meristem;root meristem;root tip;root vascular system;seed;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stem;vascular leaf;vascular leaf primordium,"

AT3G54610,protein_coding,"Description: Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG. In addition; it is involved in stem cuticular wax accumulation by modulating CER3 expression via H3K9/14 acetylation. In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.     GCN5 acts as a histone acetyltransferase in two complexes: the conserved SAGA complex and the newly identified plant-specific PAGA (plant-ADA2A-GCN5-acetyltransferase) complex, where PAGA consists of two conserved subunits (GCN5 and ADA2A) and four plant-specific subunits (SPC, ING1, SDRL and EAF6). GCN5 functions in both SAGA and PAGA complexes to activate gene expression by affecting the levels of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac in gene promoter regions. Interestingly, PAGA and SAGA can also repress gene transcription through their antagonism. In Arabidopsis, PAGA is specifically involved in plant height and branch growth by regulating the transcription of hormone biosynthesis and response related genes., Other Name: BGT;BIG TOP;GCN5;General Control Nonderepressible 5;HAC3;HAG01;HAG1;HAT1;HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE 1;HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE OF THE GNAT FAMILY 1, Keywords: flower development;positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription;positive regulation of wax biosynthetic process;regulation of vegetative phase change;response to light stimulus;root morphogenesis;chromatin remodeling;positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II;nucleus;histone acetyltransferase complex;DNA binding;acetyltransferase activity;histone H3 acetyltransferase activity;histone acetyltransferase activity;protein binding;flowering stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;collective leaf structure;cultured plant cell;flower;flower pedicel;fruit;guard cell;plant embryo;root;seed;shoot apex,"

AT1G50240,protein_coding,"Description: The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene that is involved in male meiosis cytokinesis. Cytokinesis-defective mutants; named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED., Other Name: FU;FUSED;TIO;TWO IN ONE, Keywords: cytokinesis by cell plate formation;embryo sac cellularization;male meiosis cytokinesis;cytokinesis by cell plate formation;cytoplasm;nucleus;phragmoplast;kinesin binding;protein binding;protein serine/threonine kinase activity;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;LP.06 six leaves visible stage;LP.08 eight leaves visible stage;LP.10 ten leaves visible stage;LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage;flowering stage;mature plant embryo stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo bilateral stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;plant embryo globular stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;cotyledon;flower;flower pedicel;guard cell;hypocotyl;inflorescence meristem;leaf apex;leaf lamina base;petal;petiole;plant embryo;plant sperm cell;pollen;root;seed;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stamen;stem;vascular leaf,"

AT2G26330,protein_coding,"Description: Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain; a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.

AT2G30470,protein_coding,"Description: HSI2 is a member of the ABI3 family of B3 domain proteins and functions as an active repressor of the Spo minimal promoter through the EAR motif. It contains a plant-specific B3 DNA-binding domain. It is expressed at similar levels in all organs. Treatment with 6% sucrose showed a slight increase in transcript levels after 24 h. No changes were observed after treatment with 50M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain. HSI2 is also an epigenetic repressor as it also contains functional plant homeodomain-like (PHD-L) and zinc-finger Cys- and Trp-containing (CW) domains associated with epigenetic regulation. The PHD-L domain of HSI2 is connected to promoting trimethylation of Lys-27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3); while the CW domain can bind directly to H3K4me3. Through these domains, HSI2 represses the seed maturation program during seed germination by repressing transcription of the core LAFL (LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2) seed developmental transcriptional regulators. In developing A. thaliana embryos, HSI2 suppresses expression of a large number of genes, many identified as targets of FUS3. However, the absence of HSI2 had no effect on transcript levels of the LAFL regulators and the levels of measured metabolites and phytohormones (ABA, auxin, and JA derivatives) in developing Arabidopsis embryos. HSI2 likely fine-tunes seed maturation by repressing genes involved in early embryogenesis that are not required later for seed maturation and desiccation., Other Name: HSI2;High-level expression of Sugar-Inducible gene 2;VAL1;VIVIPAROUS1/ABI3-LIKE1;VP1/ABI3-LIKE 1, Keywords: negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription;positive regulation of seed germination;regulation of seed maturation;response to abscisic acid;response to sucrose;mitochondrion;nucleus;DNA-binding transcription factor activity;protein binding;zinc ion binding;LP.02 two leaves visible stage;LP.04 four leaves visible stage;LP.06 six leaves visible stage;LP.08 eight leaves visible stage;LP.10 ten leaves visible stage;LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage;flowering stage;mature plant embryo stage;petal differentiation and expansion stage;plant embryo bilateral stage;plant embryo cotyledonary stage;plant embryo globular stage;vascular leaf senescent stage;carpel;cauline leaf;collective leaf structure;cotyledon;flower;flower pedicel;guard cell;hypocotyl;inflorescence meristem;leaf apex;leaf lamina base;petal;petiole;plant embryo;plant sperm cell;pollen;root;seed;sepal;shoot apex;shoot system;stamen;stem;vascular leaf,"

The protein binds abscisic acid (ABA) and is predicted to function as an ABA receptor. It has GTP-binding and GTPase activity and binds to ABA more effectively in the presence of GDP. GTG2 binds to GPA1; the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.  GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure.
